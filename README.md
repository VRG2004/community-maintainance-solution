# CivicFix – Community Maintenance Solution 🏘️

## Problem Statement
Communities frequently face maintenance issues such as potholes, garbage accumulation, damaged infrastructure, broken streetlights, and neglected public spaces. Existing reporting systems are often inefficient, lack transparency, and do not actively involve citizens or volunteers in the resolution process.

## Solution
**CivicFix** is a community-driven digital platform designed to empower citizens to report, track, and collaboratively resolve neighborhood maintenance issues. The solution focuses on a clear, accessible, and user-friendly UI/UX that encourages participation, transparency, and community engagement.

This project is built as a **UI/UX-focused application**, demonstrating complete user flows using front-end code without relying on a backend.
